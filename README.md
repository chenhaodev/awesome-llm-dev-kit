This repository compiles cutting-edge training and evaluation tools and resources for Large Language Models (LLMs).

### llm-autoeval
[llm-autoeval](https://github.com/chenhaodev/llm-autoeval) offers an efficient way to assess LLMs with an easy-to-use interface. Noteworthy update: Integrated `create_pods.py` with an additional argument for specifying the number of GPUs.

### lm-evaluation-harness
[lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/chenhaodev/lm-evaluation-harness) provides a comprehensive platform for evaluating generative language models across a wide array of tasks. Important update: Added databases for medical knowledge and cancer instructions.

### openai-evals
[openai-evals](https://github.com/chenhaodev/openai-evals) is the official evaluation framework and benchmark from OpenAI. Significant update: Expanded with medical knowledge and cancer instruction databases.

### llama-factory
[llama-factory](https://github.com/chenhaodev/llm-llama-factory) is a unified solution for creating and fine-tuning processes. Key update: Enriched with databases for medical knowledge and cancer instructions for training purposes.

### mergekit
[mergekit](https://github.com/chenhaodev/llm-mergekit) is a utility for integrating pre-trained language models. It supports merging operations on CPUs or with minimal GPU requirements, needing only 8 GB of VRAM.

### alpaca-cot-dataset
[dataset-cot](https://github.com/PhoebusSi/Alpaca-CoT) a repo continually broadening data collection for instruction tuning and incorporating additional large language models along with more efficient parameter techniques.

### whisper.cpp 
[whisper.cpp](https://github.com/chenhaodev/awesome-llm-dev-kit/tree/main/examples/whisper.cpp) a Python CLI/application that utilizes whisper.cpp for converting speech to text.

### rag-langchain
[rag-langchain](https://github.com/chenhaodev/awesome-llm-dev-kit/tree/main/examples/rag-langchain) is a Python CLI/application designed to employ ollama/offline-LLM and retrieve documents in paper/pdf, html, txt formats for enhanced human interaction.
